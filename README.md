### Hi there 👋

My name is Viktor Shurapov. I'm from Kyiv, Ukraine 🇺🇦
- 🏄‍♂️ I’m currently learning SwiftUI. My goal is to cover all View protocol's modifiers.
- ⚡️ Fun fact: I'm using Swift programming language since its first version! :)

Please check out my repositories! Enjoy and happy coding! 🌪️
